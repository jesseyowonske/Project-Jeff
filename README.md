## Synopsis
Project Jeff is the creation of a touch screen kiosk designed in Tech Comm (Spring 2020) for the Film and Media Studies Department at the University of Pittsburgh. The kiosk will be located within the department inside the Cathedral of Learning, and will show a calendar with upcoming events, featured staff, and descriptions of interesting classes that the department offers. 
Project Jeff will emphasize projects that the department students and staff are working on via a user-friendly touch screen.  
Project status: prototype
